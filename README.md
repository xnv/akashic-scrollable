# akashic-scrollable

> Japanese documentaion will be written later.

**akashic-scrollable** is a library that provides scrolling/clipping entities for [Akashic Engine][ae].

> Unfortunately, Akashic Engine does not provide English documentation yet.
> Whole this library is documented in English just to be prepared for their future translation.
> You need to know Japanese to use this library in practice, at least currently.

## Feature

- Simple API
  - Just `appendChild()` to `Scrollable#content` then it will be scrollable.
- Highly customizable scrollbar.

## Demo

TBD

## Install

Use `akashic` provided by [akashic-cli][cli] at the game directory root (which includes game.json):

```
akashic install @xnv/akashic-scrollable
```

or plain `npm`:

```
npm i --save -E @xnv/akashic-scrollable
npm shrinkwrap
```

Strongly recommended to shrinkwrap. (`akashic` automatically does.)

If you are using the TypeScript template generated by `akashic init -t typescript`,
you also need to run `npm install -DE @xnv/akashic-scrollable` at the project root to compile your code.

## API

will be written.
